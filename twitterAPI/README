# JavaScript Node JS Architecture 

## Notes: 
	▪	
	▪	NodeJS : For the server side. We will use Socket.IO to manage long-terms real-time connection.
	▪	Google Chrome Extension : For the client side. WebSocket, Notification and Local Storage will be used.
	▪	MongoDB : To store the datas.

To illustrate our architecture we are going to create a Node application that will track tweets about the “What’s Next” event and broadcast them in real time to the clients. The client will be a Google Chrome browser extension and will use two features of the HTML5 specification to display the tweets broadcasted by the server. In the next exercise I will introduce the MongoDB database. We will use it to store tweets and provide some statistics when the event ends.
